     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working
     with code in this repository.
     ## Project Overview
     This is a PlatformIO-based Arduino project for ESP32-based LED matrix
     displays (WS2812B). The project creates visual effects on LED matrices of
     different sizes (22x22, 24x24, or 32x48) with configurable mapping
     patterns.
     ## Development Commands

● Created CLAUDE.md with essential information about this PlatformIO LED matrix
   project. The file covers:

  - Development Commands: Build, upload, monitor, clean, and debug using
  PlatformIO CLI
  - Architecture Overview: Core components including main application, matrix
  mapping system, and alternative class-based structure in ignore/ folder
  - Hardware Configuration: ESP32-S3 target with WS2812B LEDs, supporting both
  24x24 and 32x48 matrix sizes
  - LED Mapping System: Four different mapping patterns for various display
  orientations
  - Visual Effect System: Cellular automata-style effects with intensity decay
  and neighbor ignition

  The documentation focuses on the key architectural concepts that require
  understanding multiple files to grasp the overall system design.

> I'm creating a program for an embedded platform (Arduino/ESP32) based on some
   code I found online that was written for another platform. (That code is in
  this project's /ignore folder.) The program will drive an animated display on
   a matrix of LED lights.

  I have stripped away tons of stuff that isn't necessary for my
  implementation, and have added some things that are (e.g., from the FastLED
  library).

  I haven't yet discerned the details of how the code works, but I believe it
  consists of several key elements:
  - a conceptual/back-end map of the matrix ("map") that is used in the
  calculations that generate the animation patterns
  - timing functionality that drives a display framerate for the patterns
  - a front-end FastLED controller (based on "CRGB leds") that drives the
  display based on a "myXY" of the physical LED layout.

  What I have in place now currently compiles okay, but when I try to upload it
   to my ESP32, I'm getting errors including the following:


      Re-entered core dump! Exception happened during core dump!

      Core  1 register dump:
      PC      : 0xGuru Meditation Error: Core  0 panic'ed (LoadProhibited).
  Exception was unhandled.

  I believe this may have something to do with where the code is trying to
  place or access something in memory, but I'm really not sure. Can you help?

● Looking at your code, I can see several memory-related issues that would
  cause the core dump you're experiencing. Let me analyze the main problems:

● The core dump is caused by several critical memory issues in your code:

  Main Issues:

  1. Incorrect setPixel function: You're treating the CRGB leds[] array as if
  it were a raw byte array, but CRGB is a structured type.
  2. Memory leak in tick() function: You're calling new float[NUM_LEDS] every
  frame without deleting the old array.
  3. Array bounds violation: The setPixel function calculates offsets that go
  way beyond the actual array size.

● Read(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  Read 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me fix the setPixel function first. The main issue is that you're trying
  to access CRGB leds[] array with raw byte offsets, but CRGB is a structured
  type:

● Update(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  (No changes)

> what will happen with the offsets and BYTES_PER_PIXEL info
  that you're deleting? Isn't that important for the animation
  pattern calculations?
  ⎿  ⧉ Selected 20 lines from src\main.cpp in Visual Studio Code

● You're absolutely right to question that! Let me clarify
  what's happening:

  The BITS_PER_PIXEL and offset calculations in the original
  setPixel function were incorrectly trying to treat the CRGB 
  leds[] array as a raw byte array, which is what's causing your
   crash.

  Here's what's happening:

  1. Current broken code:
    - CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS] is an array of 576 CRGB objects (for
  24x24)
    - But setPixel calculates offset = x * 3 + y * 24 * 3 which
  can be up to ~1700
    - Then tries leds[1700] = rByte - massive array overflow!
  2. The animation calculations don't use BITS_PER_PIXEL:
    - Your matrix[] array handles the animation math
    - myXY(x,y) already converts 2D coordinates to the correct
  LED index
    - The visual effects are calculated in the matrix[] array,
  not the LED array
  3. What my fix does:
    - Uses myXY(x,y) to get the correct LED index (already
  accounts for your mapping)
    - Sets leds[ledIndex] = CRGB(r,g,b) - proper FastLED usage
    - All your animation calculations remain unchanged

  The BITS_PER_PIXEL constant can stay for other uses, but
  setPixel shouldn't use it for array indexing - that's what
  myXY() is for.

  Would you like me to proceed with the fix, or do you want to
  see more explanation about how the different arrays work
  together?

> i'd love to learn more about how the arrays work together

● Great question! Let me break down how the different arrays and
   data structures work together in your LED matrix system:

● The Array Ecosystem in Your LED Matrix System

  Your system has 4 different types of arrays/data structures that work together:

  1. Conceptual Grid: matrix[NUM_LEDS] (Animation Backend)

  static float *matrix = nullptr;  // 576 floats for 24x24
  - Purpose: Holds the "conceptual" state of your animation
  - Values: Float intensities (0.0 to 1.0) representing how "bright" each pixel should be
  - Indexing: Uses myXY(x,y) to convert 2D coordinates to linear index
  - Role: This is where all your cellular automata calculations happen

  2. Physical LED Array: CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS] (Display Frontend)

  CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];  // 576 CRGB structs for 24x24
  - Purpose: FastLED's actual LED control array
  - Values: Each CRGB contains .r, .g, .b bytes (0-255)
  - Indexing: Direct array access leds[i] where i comes from myXY(x,y)
  - Role: What actually gets sent to your physical LEDs

  3. Mapping Arrays: progTopDown[NUM_LEDS] etc. (Coordinate Translation)

  const uint16_t progTopDown[576] PROGMEM = {575,574,573,...};
  - Purpose: Translate logical 2D grid positions to physical LED strip positions
  - Values: LED strip indices (0 to NUM_LEDS-1)
  - Role: Handle different wiring patterns (snake vs. progressive, top-down vs. bottom-up)

  4. Constants: BITS_PER_PIXEL, WIDTH, HEIGHT (System Configuration)

  #define BITS_PER_PIXEL 3  // R, G, B
  #define WIDTH 24
  #define HEIGHT 24

  Data Flow Pipeline

  Here's how data flows through your system each frame:

  [Animation Logic] → [Coordinate Mapping] → [Color Conversion] → [Physical LEDs]
       matrix[]           myXY(x,y)           setPixel()         CRGB leds[]

  Step-by-Step Example:

  1. Animation Calculation (in tick()):
  // For pixel at grid position (5, 10)
  const int i = myXY(5, 10);  // Returns: 394 (example)
  matrix[394] = 0.75;  // Set intensity to 75%
  2. Coordinate Mapping (in myXY()):
  uint16_t myXY(uint8_t x, uint8_t y) {
      uint16_t i = (y * WIDTH) + x;  // i = 10*24 + 5 = 245
      return progTopDown[245];       // Returns: 394 (LED strip position)
  }
  3. Color Conversion (in setPixel()):
  // Called from drawMatrix(): setPixel(5, 10, r, g, b)
  const uint16_t ledIndex = myXY(5, 10);  // 394
  leds[394] = CRGB(rByte, gByte, bByte);  // Set physical LED
  4. Physical Display (FastLED sends to hardware):
  FastLED.show();  // Sends leds[] array to actual LED strip

  Why the Original Code Crashed

  The broken setPixel was trying to do this:
  // WRONG - treats CRGB array like raw bytes
  const std::size_t offset = x * 3 + y * 24 * 3;  // Can be 1700+
  leds[offset + 0] = rByte;  // Tries to access leds[1700] in 576-element array!

  Instead of this:
  // CORRECT - uses proper CRGB indexing
  const uint16_t ledIndex = myXY(x, y);  // Always 0-575
  leds[ledIndex] = CRGB(rByte, gByte, bByte);  // Proper CRGB assignment

  Memory Layout Visualization

  Matrix Array (Animation):     CRGB Array (Display):     Mapping Array:
  [0] = 0.45  ←─────────────→   [0] = CRGB(115,200,78)   [0] = 575
  [1] = 0.82  ←─────────────→   [1] = CRGB(210,155,92)   [1] = 574
  [2] = 0.33  ←─────────────→   [2] = CRGB(84,167,123)    [2] = 573
  ...                           ...                        ...

  The myXY() function uses the mapping arrays to ensure that matrix[i] corresponds to the correct     
   physical LED position in leds[mapping[i]].

  Does this help clarify how the different pieces work together?

> yes, thank you. please proceed with suggested fixes.

● Now I'll proceed with the fixes. First, let me fix the setPixel function:

● Update(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  Updated src\main.cpp with 4 additions and 5 removals
       132      const uint8_t gByte = static_cast<uint8_t>(MAX(0.0f, min(1.0f, g)) * 255.0f);
       133      const uint8_t bByte = static_cast<uint8_t>(MAX(0.0f, min(1.0f, b)) * 255.0f);
       134
       135 -    const std::size_t offset = x * BITS_PER_PIXEL + y * WIDTH * BITS_PER_PIXEL;
       136 -  
       137 -    leds[offset + 0] = rByte;
       138 -    leds[offset + 1] = gByte;
       139 -    leds[offset + 2] = bByte;
       135 +    const uint16_t ledIndex = myXY(x, y);
       136 +    if (ledIndex < NUM_LEDS) {
       137 +      leds[ledIndex] = CRGB(rByte, gByte, bByte);
       138 +    }
       139    }
       140
       141    void tick(FrameTime frameTime);

● Now let me fix the critical memory leak in the tick() function. This is allocating new memory       
  every frame without freeing the old memory:

● Read(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  Read 45 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I need to fix the memory leak by properly managing the memory allocation. I'll change this to       
  use two static arrays that alternate, which is more efficient for embedded systems:

● Update(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  Updated src\main.cpp with 5 additions and 1 removal
       139    }
       140
       141    void tick(FrameTime frameTime);
       142 -  static float *matrix = nullptr;
       142 +  static float matrix1[NUM_LEDS];
       143 +  static float matrix2[NUM_LEDS];
       144 +  static float *matrix = matrix1;
       145 +  static float *lastMatrix = matrix2;
       146 +  static bool useMatrix1 = true;
       147
       148    void drawMatrix(float *matrix) {
       149      for (int y = 0; y < HEIGHT; y++) {

● Now I need to update the sceneSetup() function to initialize the static arrays instead of using     
   new:

● Read(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Update(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  Updated src\main.cpp with 4 additions and 3 removals
       160
       161      std::srand(std::time(0));
       162
       163 -    matrix = new float[NUM_LEDS];
       164 -  
       163 +    // Initialize both matrices with random values
       164      for (int y = 0; y < HEIGHT; y++) {
       165        for (int x = 0; x < WIDTH; x++) {
       166          const int i = myXY(x, y);
       167 -        matrix[i] = static_cast<float>(std::rand()) / RAND_MAX;
       167 +        float randomValue = static_cast<float>(std::rand()) / RAND_MAX;
       168 +        matrix1[i] = randomValue;
       169 +        matrix2[i] = randomValue;
       170        }
       171      }
       172    }

● Now I need to fix the tick() function to use the static arrays and swap between them:

● Update(src\main.cpp)
  ⎿  Updated src\main.cpp with 9 additions and 2 removals
       172    }
       173
       174    void tick(FrameTime frameTime) {
       175 -    float *lastMatrix = matrix;
       176 -    matrix = new float[NUM_LEDS];
       175 +    // Swap the matrix pointers to avoid memory allocation
       176 +    if (useMatrix1) {
       177 +      lastMatrix = matrix1;
       178 +      matrix = matrix2;
       179 +    } else {
       180 +      lastMatrix = matrix2;
       181 +      matrix = matrix1;
       182 +    }
       183 +    useMatrix1 = !useMatrix1;
       184
       185      for (int y = 0; y < HEIGHT; y++) {
       186        for (int x = 0; x < WIDTH; x++) {

● Perfect! I've fixed the major memory issues in your code:

  Fixes Applied:

  1. Fixed setPixel() Array Bounds Issue ✅

  - Before: Calculated wrong offsets treating CRGB as raw bytes, causing massive array overflows      
  - After: Uses myXY(x,y) to get correct LED index and proper CRGB(r,g,b) assignment

  2. Fixed Memory Leak in tick() ✅

  - Before: Called new float[NUM_LEDS] every frame (25+ times per second) without ever calling        
  delete[]
  - After: Uses two static arrays that swap roles each frame - no dynamic allocation

  3. Improved Memory Management ✅

  - Before: Dynamic allocation on embedded system with limited heap
  - After: Static arrays allocated at compile time - much safer for ESP32

  Key Changes:

  // Old problematic code:
  static float *matrix = nullptr;
  matrix = new float[NUM_LEDS];  // Memory leak!

  // New safe code:
  static float matrix1[NUM_LEDS];
  static float matrix2[NUM_LEDS];
  // Swap pointers each frame instead of allocating

  These fixes should resolve your core dump issues. The ESP32 was running out of memory from the      
  constant allocations and crashing from array bounds violations.

  Try compiling and uploading now - you should get a working cellular automata animation on your      
  LED matrix!

> Great. That fixed it! Thanks for the help and the lessons!

● You're very welcome! I'm glad we got it working and that the explanation of how the different
  arrays work together was helpful.

  That's a great example of how memory management issues can cause mysterious crashes on embedded
   systems - the ESP32 was getting overwhelmed by the constant new allocations and the array
  bounds violations were writing to random memory locations.

  Your cellular automata LED matrix should now be running smoothly with proper memory usage.
  Enjoy your animated display! 🎆
